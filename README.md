### **REPO ORGANIZATION**

You can find everything you need in this repository, which is organized in subfolders.
You'll find in each subfolder a `README.md` containing all the infos regarding:

1. **Introduction**
2. **How to install**
3. **Dependencies (if any)**
4. **License**
5. **Donations**
6. **(other)**

Please, refer to the badges "`development`" you can find at the top of each README, here's some additional infos:

1. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Ongoing-brightgreen.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Ongoing-brightgreen.svg)
> This means I'm currently enhancing/fixing the project. I'm open to suggestions and Pull Requests, that will be treated as soon as possible.
2. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Paused-yellow.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Paused-yellow.svg)
> This means I'm currently not considering the project as a top priority, hence issues and Pull Request will be still treated, but with higher delays. The development status can reach a higher priority ("Ongoing") or a lower one "Stopped" at any time.
3. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red.svg)
> This means I'd prefer to consider this project abandoned. I could reconsider this development status only if some really big opportunities present itselves and really worth the effort. Issues and PR will be probably read but not considered.

*As a general rule*, take in mind that my entire [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Mrcuve0) (themes included!) is based on my sparse time and it is mainly passion-driven. As for now, *my number one priority* is finishing my **Master's Degree in Embedded Systems**: don't panic if I cannot reply to your issue even after a week, I'm probably really busy and I'm making already restless nights.

### **LICENSES**
For every subfolder you'll find a specific license: many of my projects rely on other's people previous work, each of them with their proper license.
I always try to be as correct and thankful as possible: if you see some inconsistencies on licenses please be free to open an issue/PR for this repo and explain the problem. I will reply ASAP and fix the issue. The last thing I want to do is to harm someone else's IP. 

Of course, I'm expecting the same treatment in case you'll decide to publish modifications of my projects.

Finally, like *Daft Punk* said:
